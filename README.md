## Coursera Class Project for "Getting and Cleaning Data"

The class project for [Getting and Cleaning Data](https://www.coursera.org/course/getdata) was to read in the ["Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones" data set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones), perform an analysis on the data set, and output a tidy data set.

**Steps prior to running script:**

1. Download file from [this URL](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip).
2. Unzip file
3. run_analysis.R script will set the working directory to the one containing all the necessary files to run the analysis

** Analysis requires the [reshape2 package](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/reshape2/index.html), which can be downloaded from CRAN.

Output of script is a tidy data set in the .txt format.

Detailed information of the data set and script can be found in [code book](CodeBook.md).
